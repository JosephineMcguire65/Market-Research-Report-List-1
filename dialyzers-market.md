<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dialyzers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High-flux Dialyzers</li><li>Low-flux Dialyzers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The dialyzer market is primarily categorized into high-flux and low-flux dialyzers, each serving distinct patient needs in renal treatment. High-flux dialyzers utilize membranes that allow larger molecules and toxins to pass through, enabling more efficient clearance of waste products and a better overall treatment experience. In contrast, low-flux dialyzers have a tighter membrane configuration, limiting the size of solutes that can be removed. These dialyzers are often used for patients with stable conditions requiring standard waste removal capabilities.</p></p>
