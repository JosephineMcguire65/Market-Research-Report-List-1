<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Artificial Blood Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Volumetric</li><li>Vane Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The artificial blood pump market features two main types: volumetric pumps and vane-type pumps. Volumetric pumps operate by moving a specific volume of blood with each cycle, ensuring consistent flow and pressure, which is crucial for patients with heart conditions. Vane-type pumps utilize rotating vanes to create a continuous flow, offering a compact design and improved efficiency. Both types aim to enhance patient outcomes in heart surgery or failure management by supporting cardiac function and maintaining adequate circulation.</p></p>
