<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cooling Water Hydraulic Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Piston</li><li>Positive-Displacement</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Cooling Water Hydraulic Pump market is segmented into two main types: piston pumps and positive-displacement pumps. Piston pumps utilize a piston mechanism to create pressure and move coolant efficiently, offering high pressure and flow rate capabilities, making them suitable for demanding applications. Positive-displacement pumps, on the other hand, operate by trapping a fixed amount of liquid and forcing it through the discharge, ideal for consistent flow rates and volumes regardless of pressure variations, thereby ensuring reliable cooling in hydraulic systems.</p></p>
