<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve Replacement Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Balloon-Expanded</li><li>Self-Expanded</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve Replacement (TPVR) market is primarily segmented into two types: Balloon-Expanded and Self-Expanded valves. Balloon-Expanded valves are inserted using a catheter and inflated to fit snugly in place, providing precise positioning and immediate functionality. In contrast, Self-Expanded valves utilize a nitinol structure that expands at body temperature, allowing for a more adaptable fit and easier placement. Both types serve to treat pulmonary valve dysfunction, offering minimally invasive options for patients with congenital heart defects.</p></p>
