<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Green Walls Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Soil-less</li><li>Soil-based​</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Green walls are vertical gardens that can be categorized into two main market types: soil-less and soil-based systems. Soil-less green walls utilize hydroponic technologies, enabling plants to grow in nutrient-rich water solutions, ideal for urban settings with limited space. Conversely, soil-based green walls incorporate traditional soil for plant growth, providing a more natural environment and supporting larger plant varieties. Both systems enhance aesthetics, air quality, and biodiversity while promoting sustainable urban living through effective use of vertical space.</p></p>
