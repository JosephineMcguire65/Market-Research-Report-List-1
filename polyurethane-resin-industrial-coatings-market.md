<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyurethane Resin Industrial Coatings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solvent Based Coating</li><li>Waterborne Coating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The polyurethane resin industrial coatings market encompasses two primary types: solvent-based coatings and waterborne coatings. Solvent-based coatings utilize organic solvents, offering excellent adhesion and durability, making them suitable for harsh environments. However, they can emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs). In contrast, waterborne coatings use water as a primary solvent, resulting in lower VOC emissions and improved safety for users. They are increasingly favored for their environmental benefits but may require more careful application to achieve optimal performance.</p></p>
