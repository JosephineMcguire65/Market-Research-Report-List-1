<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bus Wheel Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Casting</li><li>Forging</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The bus wheel market can be segmented into three primary types: casting, forging, and others. </p><p>Casting involves creating wheels by pouring molten metal into molds, which allows for complex shapes and designs. Forging, on the other hand, involves shaping metal through deformation, resulting in stronger, more durable wheels. The "other" category encompasses alternative materials and production methods, such as composite wheels or hybrid techniques, which may cater to specific performance needs or cost considerations. Each type plays a crucial role in vehicle performance and safety.</p></p>
