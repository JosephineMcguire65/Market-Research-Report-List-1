<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Moisture Curing Polyurethane Adhesives Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquid</li><li>Hotmelt</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Moisture curing polyurethane adhesives are primarily categorized into two market types: liquid and hot melt. Liquid adhesives are primarily used for applications requiring strong bonding under varying environmental conditions, curing as moisture is absorbed from the air. Hot melt adhesives, on the other hand, are thermoplastic polymers that are applied in a molten state and solidify upon cooling, offering quick bonding and repositioning capabilities. Both types provide versatility and durability, catering to diverse industrial and consumer applications.</p></p>
