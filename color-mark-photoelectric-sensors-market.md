<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Color Mark Photoelectric Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Through-beam Sensors</li><li>Retro-reflective Sensors</li><li>Diffuse-reflective Sensors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Color Mark Photoelectric Sensors market is segmented into three main types: Through-beam Sensors, Retro-reflective Sensors, and Diffuse-reflective Sensors. Through-beam Sensors emit a beam of light and detect objects by interruption of the beam. Retro-reflective Sensors use a reflector to bounce light back to the receiver, detecting objects based on changes in light intensity. Diffuse-reflective Sensors detect objects by analyzing the light reflected directly off the object, making them versatile for various applications in automation and packaging.</p></p>
