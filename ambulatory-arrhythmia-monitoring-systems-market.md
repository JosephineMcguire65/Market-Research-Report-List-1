<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ambulatory Arrhythmia Monitoring Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>External</li><li>Implantable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ambulatory arrhythmia monitoring systems are categorized into external and implantable markets. External monitoring systems, such as Holter monitors and event recorders, are non-invasive devices worn on the body, allowing for continuous or intermittent heart rhythm tracking. In contrast, implantable devices, like loop recorders, are surgically placed under the skin for long-term monitoring, providing more comprehensive data on arrhythmias. Both types aim to enhance the diagnosis and management of cardiac irregularities, catering to varying patient needs and clinical scenarios.</p></p>
