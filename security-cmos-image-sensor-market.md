<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Security CMOS Image Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>FSI</li><li>BSI</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Security CMOS Image Sensor market features two main types: Front-Side Illuminated (FSI) and Back-Side Illuminated (BSI) sensors. FSI sensors capture light on the surface, making them suitable for applications with adequate lighting but often suffer from lower sensitivity in low-light conditions. In contrast, BSI sensors improve light capture by placing the photodiode behind the circuitry, enhancing performance in low-light environments. BSI's superior performance makes it increasingly popular for security applications, including surveillance and monitoring systems.</p></p>
