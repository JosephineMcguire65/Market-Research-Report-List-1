<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The TCR Therapy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Transduction of Chimeric Antigen Receptor</li><li>Transduction of TCR α/β Heterodimer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>TCR therapy markets can be categorized into two main types: transduction of chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) and transduction of TCR α/β heterodimers. The CAR transduction approach involves engineering T cells to express receptors that recognize specific tumor antigens, enhancing the immune response against cancer cells. In contrast, TCR α/β heterodimer transduction focuses on modifying T cells to express alpha and beta chains of T-cell receptors, enabling them to recognize a broader range of intracellular antigens, thus targeting various cancer types more effectively.</p></p>
